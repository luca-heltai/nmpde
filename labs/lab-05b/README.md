# Lab 5b: Improving the Poisson Solver (Neumann boundary conditions)

This laboratory is designed to teach you how to assemble Neumann boundary terms.

## Overview of `lab-05b.cc`

The file `lab-05b.cc` implements a finite element solver for the Poisson equation using the deal.II library. The code is designed to handle both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in a flexible way.

### Neumann Boundary IDs

A key feature of this code is the ability to specify which boundaries should have Neumann boundary conditions. This is controlled by the `Neumann boundary ids` parameter, which is read from the parameter file and stored as a set of boundary IDs. These IDs determine on which parts of the boundary the Neumann condition is applied.

- **Parameter Handling:**
  - The `PoissonParameters` struct reads the `Neumann boundary ids` from the parameter file and stores them in a set.
  - The user can specify any subset of the domain's boundary IDs to be treated as Neumann boundaries.

- **Boundary Condition Logic:**
  - During system setup, the code automatically assigns Dirichlet conditions to all boundaries **except** those listed in `neumann_boundary_ids`.
  - This is done by iterating over all boundary IDs and excluding those in the Neumann set when applying Dirichlet constraints.

- **Assembly of Neumann Terms:**
  - In the assembly loop, for each cell face, the code checks if the face is at the boundary and if its boundary ID is in `neumann_boundary_ids`.
  - If so, the Neumann boundary term is integrated over that face and added to the local right-hand side vector.

This approach allows for great flexibility: by simply changing the `Neumann boundary ids` parameter, the user can control which boundaries have Neumann conditions and which have Dirichlet conditions, without modifying the code.
